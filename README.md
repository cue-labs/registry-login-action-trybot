### `registry-login-action-trybot`

This is an almost-empty repository with no secrets or privileges that acts as a
shell for running trybot tests started from the
https://review.gerrithub.io/q/project:cue-labs/registry-login-action repository
(which replicates to https://github.com/cue-labs/registry-login-action).
